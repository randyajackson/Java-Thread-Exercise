# Java-Thread-Exercise

Write  a  program  in  Java  which  creates  producer  and  consumer  threads.  
The producer should  “produce”  by  setting  the  elements  of  an  array  of  integers  to FULL.  
The  consumer  should “consume” by setting the elements of an array of integers to EMPTY. 

Make sure you properly handle the following situations:

A  producer  (consumer)  producing  (consuming)  past  the  end  (beginning)  of  the buffer

A  producer  writing  to  an  array  element that  is  not  EMPTY  and  a  consumer reading  (i.e.  setting  the  array  element  to  EMPTY)  from  an  array  element  that  is not FULL.

Use wait()and notify()to  avoid errors  producing  and  consuming  and  to  ensure thread synchronization.
